All the mentioned topics involved practical activities, and at the end, we had to complete the following tasks:

Activity 1:
Create a custom Z table to record purchase orders sent to suppliers. This table will be populated via a function module to be created and maintained using the SM30 transaction for updates.
In this task, I applied knowledge in the creation of:
Custom Z table, views, function modules, as well as transactions SE11, SM30, SE54, SE37, and SE93.

Activity 2:
Create a program to generate a purchase order using BAPI. The data for creating the purchase order should be read from an Excel spreadsheet based on a given template.
In this task, I applied knowledge of:
Report standardization, INCLUDEs, POHEADER and POHEADERX structures, BAPI, ALV, and transactions SE80 and SE37.

Activity 3:
Create a report to display purchase order data through an ALV based on parameters provided in the selection screen.
A hotspot (link) should be created in the EBELN field within the ALV. Clicking on this field should automatically open transaction ME23N.
In this task, I applied concepts of:
Report standardization (REPORT ZXX), INCLUDEs (ZXX_TOP, ZXX_SEL, ZXX_DEF, and ZXX_IMP), class and method implementation, SELECT statements, ALV, data types, type table, and transactions SE93, SE80, and ME23N.

Activity 4:
Create a program to import data from an Excel spreadsheet and insert it into a Z table, displaying the data in an ALV.
In this task, I applied knowledge of:
Report organization (REPORT ZXX), INCLUDEs (ZXX_TOP, ZXX_SEL, and ZXX_IMP), data types, type table, SELECTION-SCREEN, cl_gui_frontend_services=>file_open_dialog, and FUNCTION 'GUI_UPLOAD'.

Activity 5:
Automate vehicle registration.
In this task, I applied concepts of:
Module POOL for the screen and ALV_GRID to display data, as well as TABELA, VIEW, SEARCH HELP, and transactions SE11, SM30, and SE80.

Activity 6:
Create a report with vehicle revision data.
In this task, I applied concepts of:
Report standardization (REPORT zXX_rel), INCLUDEs (zXX_rel_top, zXX_rel_sel, zXX_rel_forms), FUNCTION 'SSF_FUNCTION_MODULE_NAME', and SmartForms transaction to create and format the report output.
